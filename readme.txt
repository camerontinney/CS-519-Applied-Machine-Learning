How to run code, We have two datasets one for training and testing. The training dataset is a csv file called new_water.csv. Our second dataset The testing dataset is two seperate datasets that we concat together. These two are lab_results.csv and field_results.csv. We then joined these by the following function df = pd.concat([df_lab,df_field]). 
Due to the size of these datasets, they will be sent in the assingments zip file. You'll need to download these files onto your desktop, and we advise to have these datasets uploaded into documents via Jupyter notebook and you'll be able to read the datasets directly there. We have attached a simple SOP needed. 

Make sure you have Python version 3.5.2 or higher installed on your machine. We strongly advise looking at our code in Jupyter notebook. 

Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt. The required libraries pandas, numpy, time, warnings matplotlib, sklearn library, seaborn, 
Run the Python scripts for our EDA analysis and for our code with our models  which contains the solution for the tasks outlined in the project.

The results of the calculations and plots will be displayed on the console and also you can see the plots on the screen.
